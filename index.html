            <ul class="collapse in" id="starting_out_col">
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_1">Once you have left the tutorial area, talk to White-Faced Varre nearby then head North-West to the Church of Elleh and talk to Kale. Continue North to the fork in the road and grab the Grace to your West and the Grace to your East. Rest at the Grace to your East. From now on, rest often and look for the "Talk to" option in the Grace menu when resing</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_2">Head East and find a talking tree. Hit or roll into the tree to break the illusion and find Boc. Head North from there, through a small camp of enemies and go North, up through the hills to find Alexander then make your way down to grab the Grace.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_3">Go back to the starting grace and go West and downhill to the beach. In the side of the cliff North-West on the beach will be a cave where you can find Boc again. Go through or don't then go back to the Grace where you found Alexander.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_4">Head East across the bridge to find a man mourning over a dead body beside the road. Head South and West to find a Spiritjump (horse-jump) at the bottom of a ravine containing a stream. Jump down onto that Spiritjump to avoid damage and head South. After the fight, talk to Yura nearby then head into the cave by the campfire.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_5">Deep in the cave is a boss. At half-health, he will ask for mercy. If spared, reload and go back to boss room. Reload and go back again, opening the chest this time.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_6">Head just South-East until you hear some howling then head North back to the road to find a man named Kenneth on top of some ruins. Head South-East, through the forest to Fort Haight in the South-East Corner. Explore Fort Haight to get one half of the Dectus Medallion.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_7">Return to Kenneth then go back to the Church of Elleh where Kale is. Wait until nightfall at the Grace and talk to Renna nearby, then Kale to get the Fingersnap Emote.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_8">Return to the forest, where you heard the howling and use Fingersnap nearby to meet Blaidd. After talking to him, go to Fort Haight and talk to Kenneth then go back to the Grace West of that fork in the road, North of the game's start and head West through the gate.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_9">Follow the path until you reach Stormhill Shack and talk to Roderika a few times then continue North. Don't follow the path, instead go through the forest to find a broken bridge. There is a path there you can choose to take but know that it will skip parts of some questlines.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_10">You may now safely explore all of Limgrave except for Stormveil Castle without breaking anything, provided you don't go down the giant elevator near the Minor Erdtree in the Eastern forest(It's called the Siofra River Well), use any Waygates or allow yourself to get caught in any trapped chests like the one in the cave that you opened earlier. Everything else is safe.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_11">Here are some notable people and places.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_12">Knight Bernahl can be found in Warmaster's Shack on the road East of Stormhill Shack.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_13">North of Warmaster's Shack is a Coliseum with an Invader.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_1_14">East of the lake in Limgrave is the Waypoint Ruins. Under them is Sorceress Sellen</li>

              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_2_1">Go back to the starting Grace and head South-East. In the South-East corner, before you go down the slope, you will see a bunch of glowing rocks facing a circle. Go over to the circle and enter it. Blaidd will be available for you to summon if you wish. Defeat the enemy and talk to Blaidd then go down the slope.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_2_2">Cross the bridge and talk to Irina on the roadside then keep heading South.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_2_3">You can safely explore this whole area, minus Waygates and trapped chests that teleport you, without breaking anything.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_2_4">Once you're finished, go to Castle Morne in the deep South and go through the castle to find Edgar on the Ramparts. Talk to him then continue through the castle and fight the boss(Edgar is available to summon).</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_2_5">With the boss dead, talk to Edgar again then go back to Irina. After that, we are done with this zone entirely and shall never return.</li>

              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_3_2">After the first boss, rest to discover Roundtable Hold. Talk to everyone, meet and greet, beware of hugs, and then go back.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_3_3">Once both bosses are dead, go through the door behind the boss room and you will enter Lake Liurnia.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_3_4">Don't kill Gostac, the one who tells you about the side path if you want to do his quest.</li>

            </h3>
            <ul class="collapse in" id="swimming_in_the_lake_col">
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_1">So nearby should be a few NPCs depending on your choices, interact with them if you wish then head North-West down the slope to the Lake. Go North-West from here to find an island with an old friend on it, follow his instructions to go East to find a girl named Rya if you wish and if you choose to help her, go North-West to find the man she seeks.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_2">Whatever your choice, head North to the Academy Gate Town and explore the area to find Diallos with his friend.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_3">From here, explore the whole zone to your hearts content but a few warnings. Don't take the Coward's Path just yet. You'll know it by the name Ruin-Strewn Precipice. And don't go down the Ainsel River Well in the North-East. Waygates and trapped chests SHOULD be fine to take. I can't think of any that aren't.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_4">When you are finished exploring, go West of Raya Lucaria if you haven't already and grab the Glintstone Key from nearby the Dragon found there. Take it to one of the seals blocking off the academy, the closest one is North-East of Raya Lucaria on top of a broken bridge. Use the key on the seal and enter the academy.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_5">Explore the academy to your hearts content. Remember the information that the old friend gave you about the Iron Virgin below the Academy and try to avoid going down that elevator just yet. To explain, try not to let the Iron Virgin eat you. It won't necessarily break anything but I don't believe it's part of the game's "intended" path and you will be in hot lava if you do it.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_6">Besides that, explore the academy to your heart's content and eventually kill the boss and go back to Roundtable Hold. You should now have "permission" to go up the Grand Lift.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_7">Before we leave the lake though, here's a couple of things we need to do to get to other areas later.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_8">In the North-West section of the map is Caria Manor and South of it is a Giant named Iji. Go through Caria Manor and then North-West to find Ranni's Rise. This begins Ranni's Questline and leads to one of the big 3 endings. Seluvis is in the tower South of Ranni's Rise and has another questline.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_9">Along the cliffs in the South section of the map is the entrance to a town. Nepheli will be on the road here on a bunch of corpses(may require reloading the area/resting at a Grace before she appears) and in the town is a very very large pot. Try rolling into it to meet Albus and acquire the first half of the Haligtree Medallion.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_10">East of the town, also along the cliffs, is a cave. Go all the way through it and past the boss room to find Latenna. If you met Albus she will be more talkative.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_11">Revenger's Shack in the West section of the zone will have an invasion with an important item for a questline.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_12">In some ruins on the shore in the South-East will be an NPC who will appear again on the broken bridge to the East of Raya Lucaria and again in the church past the broke bridge in the North section of the map.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_13">At the Main Gate of Raya Lucaria, just to the North will be a summon sign that lets you continue Yura's Questline.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_14">In the South-West of Raya Lucaria will be the Rose Church where White-Faced Varre will be with his questline. Note: He thinks fingers are gross.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_4_15">At the East section of Lake Liurnia is Jarburg, remember this area for Diallos and Alexander's Quests. In it is Jar-bairn quest.</li>

              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_5_1">Go back to that Grace where you met Alexander in Limgrave then head along the road East. continue East to and past the Smoldering Church to the Shack of the Rotting.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_5_2">Feel free to explore. Caelid has a lot to do! You've got friendly locals, bird-watching, historical areas and plenty of dogs to pet. Just remember, please don't feed the animals.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_5_3">Here are things NOT to do. Don't enter Redmane Castle in the South-East yet(that means no touching the Waygates on the bridge nearby it also be wary of the Waygate in Fort Gaol in the South-West corner. I know it leads around here but don't remember specifically where) and other than that, the zone should be fully explorable, albeit dangerous.</li>
              <li class="" data-id="playthrough_5_4">Once you've finished you're exploration go to the Shack of the Rotting Grace back in the North-West corner. Go North-East to the cliffs and follow along them to eventually find a path to jump over to the other side. This is a more dangerous area to explore but head East, avoiding the wildlife, and if you follow the road going East you should eventually see a massive Dragon. Run past it to the left and get to the Fort Faroth Grace. Explore Fort Faroth to get the other half of the Dectus Medallion.</li>

          <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <p>The foundation of this guide was based on <a href="https://github.com/ZKjellberg">ZKjellberg</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/ZKjellberg/dark-souls-3-cheat-sheet">Dark Soul's 3 Cheat Sheet</a> source code and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roundtable_Guides/comments/tiouti/guide_to_the_intended_route_through_the_game/">Athrek's Guide to the "Intended" Route Through the Game Without Breaking Everything</a></p>
            <p>This guide has evolved thanks to the many <a href="https://github.com/azy2/Elden-Ring-Intended-Route/graphs/contributors">GitHub contributors</a> with many great suggestions, fixes and improvements!</p>

            <h3>I have feedback, how can I contribute?</h3>
            <p>You can visit the <a href="https://github.com/azy2/Elden-Ring-Intended-Route">GitHub repository</a> and <a href="https://github.com/azy2/Elden-Ring-Intended-Route/issues">report Issues</a> or create a fork and submit a Pull Request.</p>

            <h3>Do I need to follow the playthrough in this exact order?</h3>
            <p>By "intended" what I mean is that this will get you through the game in the safest way possible and with as few risks as possible. This will, in some ways, take away a lot of the open-world aspect that the game offers. It may be the "intended" story, but I don't believe it is the "intended" way to play. With that said, if you plan to stick with the game for multiple playthroughs and enjoy the "Dark Souls Experience" please wait to use this guide until at least your second playthrough. However, I completely understand if you just don't have time for multiple playthroughs or find the idea of exploring the massive open world with no direction frustrating. With there only being so many hours in a day, and only so many of those hours being available to play with, it's perfectly fine if you just want to see all there is to see in a single playthrough. That's why this guide is here. I hope that this guide can help players of all kinds to enjoy this game as much as I've been enjoying it and see all that the game has to offer! So to all my fellow Tarnished....Hang in there, skeleton!</p>

            <h3>Can I use this for multiple characters?</h3>
            <p>Yup, use the profile selector and buttons in the options tab at the top of the page to setup multiple profiles.</p>

            <h3>How does the checklist status get saved?</h3>
            <p>The checklist is saved to your browser's local storage. Be careful when clearing your browser's cache as it will also destroy your saved progress.</p>
